# Teamwork-Project-01 : Working with EC2 Snapshots, AMIs and Volumes

Purpose of the this project is to learn how to take a snapshot of EC2 instance, create an image and volume (root and additional volumes), creating another volume and instance from these snapshots, attaching and mounting new volume and instance together.

## Learning Outcomes

- At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- take snapshots of EC2 instance and volume on AWS console.

- create images from EC2 instances on AWS console.

- understand of difference between the image and the snapshot.

- create different types of AMI.

- coping and sharing AMI

- formatting and resizing additional volume and mounting with root volume 

- attaching and mounting new volume and instance together

## Outline

Part 1 - Creating an EC2 instance (EC2A) with an additional volume (10 GiB)

Part 2 - Mounting the additional volume and Adding a test.txt file to additional volume

Part 4 - Taking snapshot of the EC2 (EC2A) with 2 volumes

Part 5 - Create an instance (EC2B) from root volume's snapshop of EC2A

Part 6 - Create an additional volume (15 GiB) from additional volume's snapshop of EC2A

Part 7 - Attach and Mount EC2B and additional volume (15 GiB)

## Part 1 - Creating an Image from the Snapshot of the Nginx Server and Launching a new Instance

-  Launch an instance name EC2_A with following configurations.
 

  a. Step 1: select Amazon Linux 2 AMI
  b. Step 2: select t2.micro
  c. Step 3: For further steps note your Subnet region 
  d. Step 4: Add New Volume; Volume Type: EBS, Size 10 GiB (Note; your device column name "/dev/sdb)
  e. Step 5: Tag; Name, EC2_A
  f. Step 6: Configure Security Group; Type: SHH Port: 22
  g. Step 7: Then Creat


## Part 2 - Mounting the additional volume

# check volumes which volumes attached to instance. 
lsblk
df -h
# check if the attached volume is already formatted or not and has data on it.
sudo file -s /dev/xvdb
# if not formatted, format the new volume
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb
# check the format of the volume again after formatting
sudo file -s /dev/xvdb
# create a mounting point path for new volume
sudo mkdir /mnt/2nd-vol
# mount the new volume to the mounting point path
sudo mount /dev/xvdb /mnt/2nd-vol
# check if the attached volume is mounted to the mounting point path
lsblk
# show the available space, on the mounting point path
df -h
# check if there is data on it or not.
ls -lh /mnt/2nd-vol/
# Adding a test.txt file to additional volume
cd /mnt/2nd-vol
sudo vi test.txt
# write "Your_Name was Here.. For 2nd-vol"
# read and check "Your Name was Here.. For 2nd-vol" 
cat test.txt 

## Part 4 - Taking snapshot of the EC2 (EC2A) with 2 volumes

Go to Volume
Select Root Volume Action/creat SnapShot
  Tag: RootVolumeSnapshot

Select Additiona≈ü Volume
Action/creat SnapShot
  Tag: AdditionalVolumeSnapshot

Go to SnapShot
Select "RootVolumeSnapshot" Creat SnapShot

Go to SnapShot
Select "AdditionalVolumeSnapshot" Creat Volume




## Part 5 - Create an instance (EC2B) from root volume's snapshop of EC2A

Connect to EC2B with SSH But use "ec2-user" instead of "root"
$ ssh -i "FirstKey.pem" root@ec2-3-94-86-243.compute-1.amazonaws.com
$ ssh -i "FirstKey.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-94-86-243.compute-1.amazonaws.com

lsblk

cd /mnt/nightfighter 


## Part 6 - Create an additional volume (15 GiB) from additional volume's snapshop of EC2A



## Part 7 - Attach and Mount EC2B and additional volume (15 GiB)
